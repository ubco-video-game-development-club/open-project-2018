# The Open Project
Hello VGDC members!

To start contributing to the project, please join the Team page for this project at https://github.com/orgs/ubco-video-game-development-club/teams/open-project-2018.

## How to Contribute
This project allows everybody to contribute as little or as much as they want and still make a difference. It could be adding some voice lines, sound effects, a script, or sprites (images) - anything. This section goes through the steps of adding your creations to the project.

> Make sure you have joined the [Open Project 2018 Team page](https://github.com/orgs/ubco-video-game-development-club/teams/open-project-2018) and the [UBCO Video Game Development Club organization](https://github.com/orgs/ubco-video-game-development-club). You have to be added by an administrator, so either send Jaden Balogh a direct message through Discord, notify an admin in the Discord focused channel for the Open Project using @Admin, or send an email to ubcovgdc@gmail.com with your GitHub username.


Once you're setup, you can upload your files to the project. GitHub can be a bit hard to learn and understand, so we'll try to keep this process fairly straightforward:

1. Go to the [Code tab](https://github.com/ubco-video-game-development-club/open-project-2018) of the Open Project repository.
2. Click the button on the left-hand side that says "Branch: master" and type in a unique name that describes your changes (this can also just be your name) and press "Create branch: *yourname*". This creates a separate "branch" of the project on which you can add changes without fear of messing up anything in the actual project. Make sure the button now says "Branch: *yourname*" before continuing.
3. **If you just want to add files for others to use**, click on the Assets folder then navigate to the appropriate subfolder. Once you are in the folder where you want to add your files, press Upload Files and drag your files onto the page. 
4. When all your files are added, scroll down to the "Commit Changes" section and change the first line to a description of your newly added files and choose "Commit directly to the *yourname* branch". Then press the "Commit Changes" button! 
5. Go to step 10 if you're ready to upload your changes for everyone to access.
6. **If you are changing the Unity project itself**, you will want to first download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
7. Go into the GitHub Desktop app, and go to File > Clone Repository. You may need to sign in to your GitHub account. Scroll down to ubco-video-game-development-club, select open-project-2018, and press Clone. **Make sure the "Current branch" at the top is set to the one you created earlier!**
8. You should now have a local version of the project on your computer. To open up the project in Unity, navigate to the place where you saved the local copy on your computer and go to OpenProject2018 > Assets > Scenes > open Main.unity.
9. When you've made all your changes to the Unity project, go back to GitHub Desktop and make sure all your changes are listed on the left. If you're done, add a short summary of your changes in the bottom left and press "Commit to temp".
10. Now that you're ready to upload your changes for everyone to access, go back to the Code tab of the GitHub repository. Make sure you are on your branch, then press "New Pull Request". The only thing you have to do on this next page is add a short title and optional description for all your changes, then press "Create Pull Request".
11. Congrats, you're all done! It may seem like a lot, but all this helps immensely with keeping the project controlled and organized!

Have fun!
